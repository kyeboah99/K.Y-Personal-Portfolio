        <p><strong>Service Desk Specialist â€“ SMDI, Arlington, VA (May 2022 â€“ March 2024)</strong></p>
        <p>At SMDI, I helped users by answering help desk requests through phone and email. I installed and maintained computers, software, and security systems, making sure everything worked properly. I managed email accounts, user permissions, and mobile devices while also fixing security issues like spam and viruses. I worked with other IT team members to set up new users, troubleshoot technical problems, and improve system performance.

        <p><strong>Junior System Administrator â€“ Business PC, Laurel, MD (June 2018 â€“ May 2022)</strong></p>
        <p>In this role, I took care of company workstations and servers, making sure they were running smoothly. I helped solve computer problems, installed and upgraded software, and performed routine maintenance. I also monitored the network using tools like Splunk and SolarWinds to catch and fix problems early. My job included keeping records of system issues, training employees on basic computer use, and working with teams to test and apply changes to IT systems. I also helped with incident response to reduce downtime and keep everything running properly.</p>

I completed Cyber Security Training at Immersion Tech in June 2018, where I gained hands-on experience in threat analysis, security incident response, and system protection strategies. Additionally, I hold the CompTIA Security+ certification, validating my expertise in risk management, access control, cryptography, and network security.</p>

        <h3>Technical Skills</h3>
        <p>My skills include troubleshooting hardware and software issues, managing user accounts, monitoring network performance, and ensuring system security.
